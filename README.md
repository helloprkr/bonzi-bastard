# 🦍 BonziBuddy for macOS - Project Organization

This repository has been organized into two main directories:

## 📁 Essential

The `Essential` directory contains the **Enhanced Edition** of BonziBuddy, which is the most robust implementation with:

- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Persistent chat dialog with conversation history
- Improved UI with styled components
- Robust TTS system with multiple fallbacks
- Both synchronous and asynchronous API processing

### Quick Start:

1. Navigate to the Essential directory:
   ```bash
   cd Essential
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. Launch BonziBuddy by double-clicking the created app on your desktop

See the README.md in the Essential directory for detailed instructions.

## 📁 Backup

The `Backup` directory contains all other files from the original project, including alternative implementations and development resources.

This is kept for reference purposes only. The Essential directory contains everything needed for the recommended implementation.
